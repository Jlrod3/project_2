	<h1>The Food that I can Cook</h1>
	<p>My other passion in life is cooking, I love to look at cooking video's on youtube and become inspired, often going out to buy and use new ingredients or try out new tools to make a meal that had caught my fancy. In a different life I would have persued being a chef, but for now i'm happy keeping cooking a well loved hobby.</p>
	<p>Feel like sampling some of my more memorable meals?</p>

	  <h3>Turf n' Turf with creamed spinich & cheesy hassleback potatoes</h3>
	  <img src="images/bday.jpg" width=600 height=400 alt="steaks with sides"></img>
	  <p>Instead of going to to eat to celebrate my birthday, I was given the budget to make my own birthday dinner at home. buying all the ingredients from scratch I had grilled the steaks to a perfect medium while preparing both sides from scratch. end price was cheaper than any steakhouse we could have gone to, and cooking my own steak dinner has since become my birthday tradition.</p>

	  <h3>Pâté de Campagne</h3>
	  <img src="images/pate.jpg" width=600 height=400 alt= "country pate"></img>
	  <p>This pate was really an excuse to try out grinding my own meat. Buying a whole pork shoulder, liver and fatty bacon, I had sliced up and threw all the choosem meats into a grinder. out came a a sausage blend that had dried cherries and spices added in before put into a terrine mold and baked in a waterbath in an oven. out came a product that can be sliced and eaten among a charcuterie board.</p>

	  <h3>Homemade Doughnuts</h3>
	  <img src="images/donut.jpg" width=600 height=400 alt="boston creme donuts and Halloween themed donuts."></img>
	  <p>A sweet tooth that no kid sized candy bar could ever sate, that Halloween I took it on myself to try making yeasted fried doughnuts. Half the batch was stuffed with a boston creme style filling while the other half of the dough was cut and decorated in festive themed coloring. The spider themed donuts were a favorite</p>

	  <h3>Bone-in Porkchop with Roasted Carrots & Red Pepper Gremolada</h3>
	  <img src="images/pork.jpg" width=600 height=400 alt="Reversed seared bone-in porkchop"></img>
	  <p>Porkchops are always cooked incorrectly, often overcooked due to its associations as being "the other white meat". While it may look like chicken porkchops are better and safe to treat like cuts of beef. This specific chop was reversed seared to get a perfect medium interior that yes, was still pink. Plating was done with the roasted carrots and gremolada sauce on the bottom.</p>

	  <h3>Fried Oyster Poor Boy</h3>
	  <img src="images/poboy.jpg" width=600 height=400 alt="fried oyster poor boy"></img>
	  <p>When I saw a deal for fresh oysters to be shipped to my home, I took the chance and got to try something wonderful. While I loved to shuck and slurp down fresh oysters, some in my family were not so willing or adventurous. Thankfully a recipe followed from Alton Brown on his show <em>Good Eats</em> showed me how to make this fried oyster sandwhich that made everyone hungry for more.</p>
